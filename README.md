Constructed in Expo iOS simulator, looks perfect in at least iPhone XR - 12.1 ... as a later step I will adjust CSS to get the same appearance on an Android device.

Project published and uploaded to Expo.

Menu:
* Header with hamburgermenu, a center text element and a Homebutton.
* When click on hamburger, menu toggle depending on if isHidden is true/false.

Homepage: 
* A custom menu, one readmorebutton which links to a component.
* Two icons with links to Linkedin and Github

Github:
* Links from buttons to Github users accounts.
* I used Axios for get requests to fetch data from a Github user JSON-file on the web. 
* I used ES6 map to generate everything.
* React native elements Card to render in View containers.

Bilar: 
* The component uses React Native elements Card. 

Contact:
* Input fields from react-native-elements
* Map imported from expo
* Contact details goes to phpmyadmin db. I used PHP and Axios to accompish   that. Working on localhost so far.
* See database sql code in the tree.

Login:
* Your login details are saved in mysql database
* Click on "Login" redirect you to a hidden page
