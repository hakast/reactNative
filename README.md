Converted Angular1 (also on this Github) to a React native app.
Constructed in Expo iOS simulator iPhone XR - 12.1 and refactored to look okay in other devices too. It's possible I overlooked some of them ...

Project published and uploaded to Expo.

Homepage: 
* A custom menu, one readmorebutton which links to a component.
* Two icons with links to Linkedin and Github

Github:
* Links from buttons to Github users accounts.
* I used Axios for get requests to fetch data from a Github user JSON-file on the web. 
* I used ES6 map to generate everything.
* React native elements Card to render in View containers.

Bilar: 
* The component uses React Native elements Card. 

Contact:
* Input fields from react-native-elements
* Map imported from expo
